*/This class has a SOQL query WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED but since it is in a getQueryLocator, it doesn't work properly.
public class CreditCardSearchController {
    
    public ApexPages.StandardSetController cardList{
        get{
            if (cardList == null){
            cardList = new ApexPages.StandardSetController(Database.getQueryLocator([SELECT Name, Cardholder__r.FirstName FROM Credit_Card__c WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED]));
            }
            return cardList;
        }
        
        
        set;
    }
    
    public List<Credit_Card__c> getCards(){
        return (List<Credit_Card__c>) cardList.getRecords();
    }
    
}
